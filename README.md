## Detailed Features

### Composition and Architecture

This IoT (Internet of Things) device is engineered using an integrative approach that combines PHP, JavaScript, and Python. At its core, it utilizes a Raspberry Pi (4B model) as the primary computing unit.

An Apache web server is installed on the Raspberry Pi, supporting PHP. Users can interact with the device through a frontend interface developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This user-friendly interface features an array of functional buttons for efficient control.
